- Accelerate delivery velocity
- Help management identify issues

::: notes
- How do you know if you could accelerate your delivery velocity?
- There could be a wide variety of issues at play
    - Examples include (mention 3-4): 
        - Delays in approval 
        - Inadequate communication
        - Insufficient testing 
        - Incomplete code 
        - Conflicts 
        - Security concerns 
        - Insufficient resources
        - Changes in priorities
        - Third-party tool dependency
        - Lack of goals 
        - Turnover
        - Ineffective monitoring 
        - Inefficient development 
        - Difficulty integrating software components 
- How do you help your management team see and care about those issues?

# How'd it go? {data-background-image="images/space_tribunal.png"}

::: notes
- Interviews are time-consuming and biased:
    - not everybody was invited
    - not everybody who was invited spoke their minds
    - a survey would be much better
        - make sure it aggregates results at the team level, not the individual level

:::
